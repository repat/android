Surespot Android Client
======
**surespot** is a mobile messaging application that secures all messages using end-to-end encryption.

surespot is free to download and free to use because we believe that every person has the right to access a tool they
can use to communicate without being subjected to data mining, behavior trending, and other surveillance liberties
corporations and authorities have taken with our communications. We created surespot because we were tired of editing ourselves.
If you support this work and appreciate surespot please show it and consider donating your [time or money](https://www.surespot.me/contribute.html).
In turn, we will pass along support to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) who work tirelessly to defend your digital rights.
